    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <hr>

    <p> <img src="joe.jpg" height="200px" width="200px">My name is Felix Asare and am a part time student in the Full Stack Web Development program with UT Austin. 
        Usually Felix try his very best to skip talking about me since it is one of the areas am not really good at. However, this is better than standing up in class stammering my way through so Felix will give it my best shot. </p>
    <p>Felix is originally from Ghana but moved to the United States early January 2009 and resided in New York City until he joined the United States Army in 2012 working as a Culinary Specialist where he was able to learn many skills especially on creativity. Commitment and hard-work has always been his hallmark and this was rewarded with many honors in a very fast and harsh working environment.
            Felix completed his Bachelors Degree in Sports Management at St Johns University and before that a Diploma in Marketing at Accra Polytechnic. Felix has always have the passion of how the internet work and that led his path to enroll in the UT Website Development certificate program.
            Not only is Felix a skilled and detailed oriented person but he is also very compassionate. In his free time, he likes to be active and seek adventure at all times. He also spend a lot of time looking at new technologies and playing with it to see how he can upgrade or create a project of his own. 
            As hard as it was from the beginning of these few paragraphs, am happy to say we got it DONE!! </p>
